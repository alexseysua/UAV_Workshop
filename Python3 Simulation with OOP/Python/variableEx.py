#variableEx.py: a and b are the variables
# which stores 3 and 5 respectively
a=3
b=6

# following line will add value of a i.e. 3 with 6
print(a+6) # 9

# following line will perform (3+5)/2
print((a+b)/2) # 4.5

# following line will perform (3+5)/2 
# and then display the interger value only
print(int((a+b)/2)) # 4
