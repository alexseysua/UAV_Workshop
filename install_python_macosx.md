## Install in mac osx

### Install brew 
To install Homebrew, open Terminal or your favorite OS X terminal emulator and run
```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file
```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```
If you have OS X 10.12 (Sierra) or older use this line instead
```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
```
Now, we can install Python 3:
```
$ brew install python
```





### Working with Python 3
At this point, you have the system Python 2.7 available, potentially the Homebrew version of Python 2 installed, and the Homebrew version of Python 3 as well.
```
$ python 
```
will launch the Homebrew-installed Python 3 interpreter.
```
$ python2 
```
will launch the Homebrew-installed Python 2 interpreter (if any).
```
$ python3 
```
will launch the Homebrew-installed Python 3 interpreter.

If the Homebrew version of Python 2 is installed then pip2 will point to Python 2. If the Homebrew version of Python 3 is installed then pip will point to Python 3.

The rest of the guide will assume that python references Python 3.

Do I have a Python 3 installed?
``` 
$ python --version
Python 3.7.1 # Success! 
```
